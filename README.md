# Overview

Yeah, so I thought cpp language is queite hard and demanding but it appears my info was outdated.
I've done the simple libraray console application that, for now, have a few test books created every iteration and options to show those books,
rent and return a book. 
I was a bit lazy in making it so far.
Possibly it will have mechanic of whenever the app loads it loads the list of books from previous session, which might be saved as CSV file, or connected and retrieved from SQL DB.
